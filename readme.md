》I love Indie RPGMaker games and horror-like, I'm also a big fan of Umamusume and VTubers in general. I don't bite, I'm just shy!

》I'm someone who cares a lot of those who are close to me and I might be a little annoying when it comes to health at first ^-^

 》 I don’t talk very much. I’m better at listening. I think I prefer it that way too.

 》 Sarcasm and irony are hard for me. I’m slow to catch on and don't really understand sometimes.

 》 I'm usually off-tab and don't check public chat... whispers are preffered! I do not engage in drama or pointless arguments, so please don't drag me into one.

 》 I hide + block freely, I dislike ignorance and rudeness.
 
 》 I tend to avoid a lot problematic fandoms, don't take it to the heart if I'm wary at first.. '^-^
