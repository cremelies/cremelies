   ***___🌷 Hi there — I'm Cremelies!___***

<h5 align="center">
》I really like Idols and RPGMAKER games & tend to love vtubers(hi holotown). While I may look sensitive and a bit "fragile" I assure you I can handle way more than anyone would ever be able to tell. I also am really like Nanashi Mumei and Ceres Fauna; those are my favourites vtubers and will forever be my on-top. I may act like Mumei or Fauna at times, so please bear with me. ^w^


<h5 align="center">
  
》I care A LOT... if we ever become friends, please be a little ready for how annoying i might be sometimes. Keep in mind that I'm really avoidant and have a STRONG conviction on what I think; I'm not one to change minds easily. If you're making me uncomfortable or making me feel unsafe it'll be VERY visible.

 》 I'm a really introverted person and tend not to talk a lot, I often listen more than I speak and I prefer it that way. I'm really selective of those who I'm more verbal about, so don't take it to the heart if you see me acting a bit more differently with someone else.

 》 I don't like sarcastic or ironic comments, I'm really slow to understand things and it makes me feel bad... while I don't mind as a joke, it still might make me feel a bit sour and down. I'd only ask to be a bit considerate, unless I'm at my "Owl" or "Kirin" mode. '^.^

 》 I’m usually off-tab and often only reply to whispers. C+H freely unless I’m with someone, or if my name says not to. I really enjoy some presence so if you see me alone please don't hesitate to sit or cuddle, although that depends on my name in-game too.

 》 I hide + block freely, I do not make exceptions if anything/anyone makes me uncomfortable

 》 I avoid by all meanings problematic fandoms, so please don't take it in the wrong way if I'm wary at first. It's nothing personal, I just don't want to associate with some problematic people.
