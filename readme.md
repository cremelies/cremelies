   ***___🔥 Hello, name's Cremelies.___***

<h5 align="center">
》I really like Idols and RPGMAKER games & tend to love vtubers(hi holotown). I'm a big fan of Sachi and Nimi Nightmare and may act like them. My interests are... pretty much anything, just ask ^p^
  
》Check links, ok? ok.

<h5 align="center">
  
》I care A LOT... if we ever become friends, please be a little ready for how annoying i might be sometimes. Keep in mind that I'm not one to change minds easily. If you're making me uncomfortable or making me feel unsafe it'll be VERY visible.

 》 I'm a really introverted person and tend not to talk a lot, I often listen more than I speak and I prefer it that way. I'm really selective of those who I'm more verbal about.

 》 I don't like sarcastic or ironic comments, I'm really slow to understand things and it makes me feel bad... while I don't mind as a joke, it still might make me feel a bit sour and down. I'd only ask to be a bit considerate, unless I'm really nonchalant atm... '^.^

 》 I’m usually off-tab and often only reply to whispers.

 》 I hide + block freely, I do not make exceptions if anything/anyone makes me uncomfortable. I REALLY dislike ignorance and assumptions... so please keep that away from me.

 》 I avoid by all meanings problematic fandoms, so don't take it in the wrong way if I'm wary at first.
