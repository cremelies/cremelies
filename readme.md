   ***___🔥 Hello, name's Cremelies.___***

<h5 align="center">
》I really like Idols and RPGMAKER games! I'm also a big fan of vtubers and umamusume in general. I may act like Nimi Nightmare or Sachi sometimes.

》I care A LOT for my friends and family, so if we ever get along... you might want to be ready for how annoying I might be when it comes to health! '^w^

 》 I'm a really introverted person and tend not to talk a lot, I often listen more than I speak and I prefer it that way. I'm really selective of those who I'm more verbal about.

 》 I don't like sarcastic or ironic comments, I'm really slow to understand things and it makes me feel bad... while I don't mind as a joke, it still might make me feel a bit sour and down. I'd only ask to be a bit considerate, unless I'm really nonchalant atm... '^.^

 》 I’m usually off-tab and often only reply to whispers. I also do not engage in pointless arguments or drama that is dragged to me, so keep that in mind.

 》 I hide + block freely, I do not make exceptions if anything/anyone makes me uncomfortable. I REALLY dislike ignorance and assumptions.

 》 I avoid by all meanings problematic fandoms, don't take it in the wrong way if I'm wary at first.
